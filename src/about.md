# About Me

I have been working as a software engineer in the industrial/warehouse mobile robotics industry since 2013. I've independently designed and developed real-time monitoring software that currently manages a fleet of *over ten thousand robots operating worldwide.*

Most of my work cannot be shared due to intellectual property limitations. But here are some small side projects to check out:

- [Game Boy Emulator](/posts/gameboy)
- [Cancelâ„¢](/posts/cancel/)

I completed both a BES and MSc in Geography at the University of Waterloo.

I love exploring new software and languages, but am already very comfortable with:

* TypeScript, Python, Rust, C#
* Django, React, AWS/CDK, Postgres
* [ROS](https://ros.org/) - the Robot Operating System
* QGIS, ESRI, ENVI, ERDAS, Geomatica

Most of my time is enjoyed being a parent to two boys, which usually means getting into lots of mischief. When I'm not doing any of that, I'm likely on the piano, working on some construction projects (such as rebuilding an entire deck and patio), or writing software for fun.
