# About Me

I have been working as a software engineer in the industrial/warehouse mobile robotics industry since 2013. I've independently designed and developed real-time monitoring software that currently manages a fleet of *over ten thousand robots operating worldwide.*

Today I lead a team of software engineers in developing mobile robot mapping, fleet configuration, and monitoring applications for Web, dashboard, and mobile uses in large warehouse spaces.

Most of my time is enjoyed being a parent to two boys, which usually means getting into lots of mischief. When I'm not doing any of that, I'm likely on the piano, working on some construction projects (such as rebuilding his deck and patio), or writing software for fun. I completed both a BES and MSc in Geography at the University of Waterloo.

## Development Philosophy

I thrive in situations where I need to wear many hats, which is why I've done so well at young start-ups.

For example, I was hired with for specific mission: "we need to configure and monitor robot deployments without regular involvement from engineers."  This was accomplished by interviewing the deployment and customer success staff to understand the workflows, challenges, and opportunities. From that I could prototype an application, write the front-end, back-end, database schema, validation, backup strategy, cloud deployment, CI/CD, user manuals, and service monitoring tooling.

This process was not monolithic. The best way to build the right tool is to ship it early and often so that you can learn through production usage what works, what is lacking, and what you don't yet know about a problem. A prototype was available within a few weeks and has seen hundreds of improvements over the years.

Once our product matured and our customer base grew by multiple orders of magnitude, I handed out my many hats to a team that I hired and manage today.


## Tech Overview

Sometimes it helps build a mental model of someone by looking at the tools they use:

* TypeScript, Python, Rust, C#
* React, Django, AWS/CDK, Postgres
* [ROS](https://ros.org/) - the Robot Operating System
* QGIS, ESRI, ENVI, ERDAS, Geomatica
