## Why "Today's Pointless Click"?

It's probably a bad name because I once had a recruiter think I was insulting her with a nonsense URL.  But I like it for some reason.

The original reason was that I would make these little pointless toys such as mini games, web widgets that don't do anything, etc. Also, there's a really bad pun with the cursor having no point to the top of it.
