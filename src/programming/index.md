# Programming

Assorted older projects of the programming variety. Some assorted software libraries or other experiments.


# Aiorospy
*April 1, 2019*

An `asyncio` wrapper for `rospy`.  This allows us to use the async concurrency model with Rospy instead of threading.

This doesn't fix any of the fundamental problems with Rospy as it still uses threads behind the scenes. But your userspace code will be much cleaner!

This work was co-developed by and is now maintained by a colleague.

# Minibus
*September 1, 2019*

I wrote a Modbus server for an ESP-8266 for fun and learning. This was done around the time I was working on writing adapters for Modbus + OPC/UA + ROS to make it easier for a robot fleet to talk with industrial systems.

# The Periodic Table of GitHub
*November 11, 2017*

Because naming repositories is hard so let's pick element names! Unfortunately this one doesn't work too well on mobile.

# Leaflet Simple Graticule
*October 1, 2014*

A graticule, but for unprojected Cartesian spaces.
