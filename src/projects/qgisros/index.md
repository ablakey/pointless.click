# QGIS ROS
*July 1, 2018*

I prototyped a software library that bridges ROS (the Robot Operating System) and QGIS, an open source GIS application. The goal was to introduce decades of mature mapping and GIS technology to the mobile robotics world to make spatial analyis of robot-collected data easier than imagined. Domain experts have a habit of seeing all problems through their subject matter expertise, and often overlook very mature toolsets and methodologies.

I presented this work in 2018 at ROSCon in Madrid.
